Used squoosh to resize my images so that it could fit and also look nice on the website. Implementing img code to put the image on the site. Using figcaption to caption the video and hr for separating the pictures so it looks nice. When designing the borders i put the sections in specific places so that i looks good on the website.

Learned how to implement a video into the website using iframe and figcaption similar to the gallery section of my website.

In the web forms area I finally learned how to make a good color scheme when it came to the part for adding some style. I also learned how to create inputs and a feildset for designing how each box would react to different types like text and email.  

Finally, the navigation bar, i learned how to make the navigation bar motions by putting in the code called transitions. Also making it opacity slightly low so that it doesnt fully block the stuff behind the navigation bar.
