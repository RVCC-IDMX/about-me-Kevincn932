                <h3>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h3>
            <div>
                

                <p>Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get something out of you."</p>

                <p>"Money, I suppose," said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. "Well, sit down and tell me all about it. 
                    Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything."</p>

                <p>"Yes," murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; "and when they grow older they know it. 
                    But I don't want money. It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine. 
                    Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's 
                    tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not useful information, of course; 
                    useless information."</p>

                <p>Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those fellows 
                    nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better. 
                    But I hear they let them in now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end. 
                    If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him."</p>

                <p>Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George," said Lord Henry languidly.</p>

                <p>"Mr. Dorian  Gray? Who is he?" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white eyebrows.</p>

                <p>"That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who he is. 
                    He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux. 
                    I want you to tell me about his mother. What was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in your time, 
                    so you might have known her. I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him."</p>

                <p>"Kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman. "Kelso's grandson! ... Of course.... I knew his mother intimately. 
                    I believe I was at her christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, 
                    and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, 
                    a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday. 
                    The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, 
                    some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. 
                    The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and 
                    she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had forgotten that. What sort 
                    of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he must be a good-looking chap."</p>
