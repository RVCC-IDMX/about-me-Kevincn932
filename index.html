               <div>
                    <p>I am a rvcc student that is majoring in IT(Informational Technology). I will be there until my 3rd year and then transfer to NJIT. A technology school that my cousin also goes to. 
                    <p>Currently work at a job at Walmart from 7 to 4 on Friday and Sunday and also work from 7 to 12 on a Saturday. I work in claims, what this means is that i claim items out so that we can keep track of it. I have the option to put stuff out for sell it for a lower price, dispose, or donate an item. </p>
                    <p>During 8th grade my cousins showed me how to solve a rubix cube. He showed a video on how to do it in 7 steps and managed to memorize it and do it myself. Also went to Florida twice, once with my cousins over the summer. Since we were the same age we had lots of fun there with a funny picture of us putting our thumbs down. </p>

                <h3>CSS Animation</h3>
             <div>
                 
                        <p>CSS animations is a tool used to animate a specific object and it doesn't have to be used for java script. CSS itself is using colors for a background or using a border for a specific location in the section of the code. When you use CSS animations you can switch the borders colors to get a nice animation. Some websites I've seen use an animation where the text moves into the website as you scroll down.  
  
                        <br>There are 10 different codes that can be used for animations </br> 
                    
                    
          
                        
                        <br>Animation-delay -- It delays the time when the animation starts and when you use negative integers for the value it will skip the animation by how much time you put in. </br>                 
                        <br>Animation-direction -- This adds a direction of which way it would go like backwards or forwards or alternate between them.  </br>            
                        <br>Animation-Duration -- This shows the amount of time it would take to get from one end to the other using some amount of time.  </br>
                        <br>Animation-fill-mode -- It applies styles before and after it is executed. </br>
                        <br>Animation-iteration-count -- Repeats the animation by how many times it is on like 0 or 3.  </br>
                        <br>Animation-name -- shows what effect you can have on it like bouncing or sliding. The key frame shows the beginning and end points for an action like shrinking it or color change. </br>
                        <br>Animation-play-state -- This can show the animation paused or running. </br>
                    
                        <br>Animation-timing-function -- This shows how the animation will be going when it goes through the cycle of the animation.  </br>
                
                        <br>Animation-composition -- these combine many sources(or just one source) together creating one image visually. </br>
                    
                        <br>For this example, I've shown what you can do when using multiple of these codes at the same time. </br>
                    
                        <div id="box">&#128515;</div>    
                    
                        <p>In fact, websites use animations to drag users to their site as it would provide the reader with a good experience and entertain them. Some animations used on websites would be using text animation where the text appears on the screen as if you were typing it in, in real time. The color animation where it alternates between colors. The slide-in animation where an image or text appears on screen as it moves in the section this animation is similar to the fade-in. Rotate animation is where you use an item to rotate in a cycle. The wave animation is a mixture of different elements in cycles of rotations creating a wave effect. For the glowing effect is like the hover effect where you change the background to be blurry with a bright color and when you hover over it, it looks like it glows. The bounce animation could be used as a loading screen. It uses multiple elements to create the effect of multiple objects bouncing at different intervals. When websites take too long to load, they add a loading animation till the page loads in. The hover animation is when you either click it or put your mouse over it will react to it. You can change its color, shrink it, expand it, etc. This is my favorite animation since it looks satisfying once you hover over it. </p>
